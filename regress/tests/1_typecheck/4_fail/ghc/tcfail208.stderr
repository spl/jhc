    Could not deduce (Eq (m a)) arising from a use of `=='
    from the context (Monad m, Eq a)
      bound by the type signature for
                 f :: (Monad m, Eq a) => a -> m a -> Bool
      at tcfail208.hs:4:1-23
    Possible fix:
      add (Eq (m a)) to the context of
        the type signature for f :: (Monad m, Eq a) => a -> m a -> Bool
      or add an instance declaration for (Eq (m a))
    In the expression: (return x == y)
    In an equation for `f': f x y = (return x == y)
