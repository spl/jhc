    Couldn't match type `a' with `(?p::Int) => a0'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          a type expected by the context: a -> String at T3102.hs:11:10
    Expected type: a -> String
      Actual type: ((?p::Int) => a0) -> String
    In the first argument of `f', namely `t'
    In the expression: f t
