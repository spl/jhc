    Couldn't match expected type `Bool' with actual type `Int'
    In the return type of a call of `foo'
    In the expression:
      foo
        [a ~?= b, "Three" ~?= "3", "Four" ~?= "4", "Five" ~?= "5", ....]
    In an equation for `allTests':
        allTests = foo [a ~?= b, "Three" ~?= "3", "Four" ~?= "4", ....]
