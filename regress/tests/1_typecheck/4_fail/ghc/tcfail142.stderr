    Ambiguous type variables `a0', `r0' in the constraint:
      (Bar a0 r0) arising from a use of `bar'
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
    In the first argument of `foo', namely `bar'
    In the expression: foo bar
    In an equation for `test': test = foo bar
