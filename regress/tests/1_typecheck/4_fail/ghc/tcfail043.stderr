tcfail043.hs:38:17:
    Ambiguous type variable `a0' in the constraints:
      (Ord_ a0) arising from a use of `gt' at tcfail043.hs:38:17-18
      (Eq_ a0) arising from a use of `eq' at tcfail043.hs:40:25-26
    Possible cause: the monomorphism restriction applied to the following:
      search :: a0 -> [a0] -> Bool (bound at tcfail043.hs:37:1)
    Probable fix: give these definition(s) an explicit type signature
                  or use -XNoMonomorphismRestriction
    In the expression: gt (hd bs) a
    In the expression:
      if gt (hd bs) a then
          False
      else
          if eq a (hd bs) then True else search a (tl bs)
    In the expression:
      \ a bs
        -> if gt (hd bs) a then
               False
           else
               if eq a (hd bs) then True else search a (tl bs)
