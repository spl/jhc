    Couldn't match type `t' with `s'
      `t' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for f :: ST t Int at tcfail103.hs:11:1
      `s' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for g :: ST s Int at tcfail103.hs:15:9
    Expected type: STRef s Int
      Actual type: STRef t Int
    In the first argument of `readSTRef', namely `v'
    In the expression: readSTRef v
