
LongWayOverlapping.hs:23:11:
    No instance for (EmbAsChild [Char] Char)
      arising from a use of `emb'
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for (EmbAsChild [Char] Char)
    In the expression: emb 'c'
    In an equation for `emb': emb _ = emb 'c'
    In the instance declaration for `EmbAsChild [Char] Bool'
