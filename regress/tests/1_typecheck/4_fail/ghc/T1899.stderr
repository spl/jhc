    Couldn't match type `a' with `Proposition a0'
      `a' is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for transRHS :: [a] -> Int -> Constraint a
          at T1899.hs:10:2
    Expected type: [Proposition a0]
      Actual type: [a]
    In the first argument of `Auxiliary', namely `varSet'
    In the first argument of `Prop', namely `(Auxiliary varSet)'
