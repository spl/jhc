    Warning: -XDatatypeContexts is deprecated: It was widely considered a misfeature, and has been removed from the Haskell language.

tcfail102.hs:9:15:
    Could not deduce (Integral (Ratio a)) arising from a use of `p'
    from the context (Integral a)
      bound by the type signature for
                 f :: Integral a => P (Ratio a) -> P (Ratio a)
      at tcfail102.hs:9:1-19
    Possible fix:
      add (Integral (Ratio a)) to the context of
        the type signature for
          f :: Integral a => P (Ratio a) -> P (Ratio a)
      or add an instance declaration for (Integral (Ratio a))
    In the `p' field of a record
    In the expression: x {p = p x}
    In an equation for `f': f x = x {p = p x}
