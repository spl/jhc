    Warning: -XDatatypeContexts is deprecated: It was widely considered a misfeature, and has been removed from the Haskell language.

tcfail137.hs:8:5:
    No instance for (Floating Bool)
      arising from a use of `Test'
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Floating Bool)
    In the expression: Test [False, True]
    In an equation for `x': x = Test [False, True]
