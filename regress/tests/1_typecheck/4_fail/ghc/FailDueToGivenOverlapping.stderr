    Overlapping instances for E [t0]
      arising from a use of `eop'
    Matching instances:
      instance E [a] -- Defined at FailDueToGivenOverlapping.hs:21:10
    Matching givens (or their superclasses):
      (E [Int])
        bound by the type signature for bar :: E [Int] => () -> ()
        at FailDueToGivenOverlapping.hs:27:1-23
