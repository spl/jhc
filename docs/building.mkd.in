Installation of jhc
===================

All versions of jhc are available from the
[Download Directory](http://repetae.net/dist/). The project is
also under darcs revision control however the build process from darcs is
somewhat more involved. For information on getting the source code from darcs
and building it, see the [Development Page](development.shtml).

Getting the RPM
---------------

This is by far the easiest way to go about it if you have an rpm based system, an RPM for x86 based systems
 can be instaled from:
<http://repetae.net/yum/@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@-@RPMRELEASE@.i386.rpm>.
There is also a 'src' rpm in the download directory for rebuilding from source.

Building from the tarball
-------------------------

jhc is also distributed via a autoconf/automake style tarball. Building jhc
has the following dependencies:

 * GHC 6.8.2 or better
 * haskell library [binary](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/binary)
 * haskell library [zlib](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/zlib)
 * haskell library [utf8-string](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/utf8-string)

You can get the tarball
at <http://repetae.net/dist/@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@.tar.gz>. In order
to build it, download it into a directory and perform the following

    tar zxvf @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@.tar.gz
    cd @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@
    ./configure && make

then as root run

    make install


A note on libraries
-------------------

All these prepackaged versions of jhc come with prebuilt versions of the
'base' and 'haskell98' libraries for use by jhc in addition to the sourcecode
for these libraries. You can rebuild them if you wish simply by deleting the
'.hl' files in your build directory and doing a 'make libs'. however it is
recommended you work with the development darcs tree if you plan on modifying
the base libraries.
