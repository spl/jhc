Announcing jhc 0.7.6! This release fixes a large number of bugs that cropped up
when compiling hoskell out in the wild. In addition it has some major internal
cleanups and better support for cross-compilation. This is a minor release in
that I am just announcing it on jhc@haskell.org.

Changes:

 * New standard libraries
     - parsec
     - QuickCheck
 * New option '-C' that compiles to C code and stops, useful for targeting other
   platforms or building shared libraries.
 * Nintendo Wii added as target (thanks to Korcan Hussein)
 * All Num, Real, and Integral magic removed from compiler. This is a very
   good thing.
 * monomorphism-restriction flag is now respected
 * Type Defaulting now works properly
 * RULES parse like ghc now for compatibility
 * 'do' 'where' on same indent now parses
 * improved help messages
 * a number of bug fixes
