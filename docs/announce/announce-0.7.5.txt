Announcing jhc 0.7.5! This mainly fixes some bugs that came up in peoples testing of
0.7.4 and includes a lot more libraries in the standard install and better standards
support.

Any testing people can do with the new garbage collector -fjgc would be greatly
appreciated! As far as I know, this release has no regressions when using the new
GC, so it will be enabled by default if I get no reports of problems with this
release.

Major changes

 * The Garbage Collector now fully supports the the Windows, OSX 10.5 (leapord),
   and OSX 10.6 (snow leapord) targets.

     - added Debug.Trace
 * support for adding valgrind annotations to generated source for
   debugging the RTS.
 * support for having the generated code annotate every heap location with
   useful profiling/debugging info. useful for debugging the RTS.

   tests cross-compiled for windows.

   of abstract Name and its faster operations, faster typechecking/frontend and
   code simplification opprotunities result.
