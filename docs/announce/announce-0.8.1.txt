After a hiatus, jhc 0.8.1 is released.

http://repetae.net/computer/jhc

- New license, jhc is now released under a permissive BSD style licence rather
  than the GPL. The license is compatible with that of ghc allowing code mixing
  between them.

- New library layout based around the standards, there are now haskell98 and
  haskell2010 packages that are guarenteed to be future proof strictly
  compatible with the respective standards. A package haskell-extras contains
  the additonal libraries from ghc's base.

- Native support for complex and vector SIMD primitives, exposed via type
  functions.  for instance 'foo :: Complex_ Float32_' for hardware accelerated
  complex 32 bit floats for instance. These are unboxed only for now, full
  library Num support in the works.

- support for android as a target, you must install the android NDK to use this.

- Support for embedded ARM architectures imported from Kiwamu Okabe's branch
  allowing targeting bare hardware with no OS.

- user defined kinds, introduced with the 'kind' keyword otherwise looking like
  'type' declarations.

- export/import lists now allow namespace qualifiers kind, class, type, or data
  to explicitly only import or export the specific named entity. As an
  extension allowed by this, classes and types no longer are in the same
  namespace and can share names.

- ForeignPtr's now have working finalizers when collected by the RTS.

- CTYPE pragma to allow promoting arbitrary C types to FFIable entities.
