# Building Projects With make

using make to build projects with jhc is straightforward, simply add a line like the following in your Makefile


    % : %.hs
            jhc -v $< -o $@

If you wish jhc to automatically generate dependency information, you can do the following

    % : %.hs
            jhc --deps depend.make -v $< -o $@

    -include depend.make



    %.hl : %.cabal
            jhc -v --build-hl $< -o $@
