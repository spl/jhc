# Dependency Information

Jhc can output dependency information describing how source files and libraries
depend on each other while compiling code. The dependency information is
generated when the --deps name.yaml option is passed to jhc. It is presented in the
standard YAML format and its fields are as described below.

  - LibraryDeps: the libraries that are dependend on. It is a hash of library ids to the specific filename of the library used.
  - LibraryDesc: if building a library, this field contains the name of the library description file used.
  - ModuleDeps:  a hash of module names to the list of modules that are directly dependend on by said module.
  - ModuleSouce: a hash of module name to the haskell source file used.

An example tool to processs the deps.yaml file and spit out appropriate Makefile rules is included as 'utils/deps_to_make.prl'.
